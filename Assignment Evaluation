Were the expectations clear? 
What parts really connected with you? 
Could any topics have been presented better? 
Was any of the assignment a review for you?

Pre-Work=
I thought the expectations for the prework were pretty clear.  I had some trouble with some of the inital terminology
with GitHub, but after looking through some of the other students assignments, that helped quite a bit.

I really connected with the first half of the book that walked step by step through Ruby and built concepts on 
top of each other.  I also enjoyed GitHub quite a bit more once I understood it.

I think there could be a brief YouTube video reviewing or providing an overview for some of the assignments.  I'm a
visual learner so that would've helped quite a bit when I got lost.

None of the assignment was review for me.

  DAY 1 = The expectations were a little fuzzy as I don't remember going over parts of the lesson in class, so maybe a
verbal expectation would be good as well to ensure we don't miss anything.

I really started to get array's and struggling getting through them, but seemed to begin to understand them.

Git was extremely confusing and still unclear as to how that works and how it interacts with GitHub.

The assignment was review of the lesson.  After this first lesson, I'll take better notes moving forward though
as once I got to the homework, it was extremely hard to find references when I got stuck.

    DAY 2 - Today, the expectations were the most clear that they've been....we discussed Git in detail and in using
    it each time, it progressively gets better!
    
    git and github connecting connected a lot today....I've updated my git from text editor several times
    and each time, I get a sense of achievement
    
    I'm still a little fuzzy on some of the complex Ruby concepts, but assume that will come with time.
    
    None of the assignment was a review, it was all a challenge and all were new concepts.
