Were the expectations clear? 
What parts really connected with you? 
Could any topics have been presented better? 
Was any of the assignment a review for you?

I thought the expectations for the prework were pretty clear.  I had some trouble with some of the inital terminology
with GitHub, but after looking through some of the other students assignments, that helped quite a bit.

I really connected with the first half of the book that walked step by step through Ruby and built concepts on 
top of each other.  I also enjoyed GitHub quite a bit more once I understood it.

I think there could be a brief YouTube video reviewing or providing an overview for some of the assignments.  I'm a
visual learner so that would've helped quite a bit when I got lost.

None of the assignment was review for me.
