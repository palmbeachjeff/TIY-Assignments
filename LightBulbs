Learnings from the first day of class:

I understand how to use and the interaction of strings, integers, and arrays.

I really feel comfortable with a lot of the syntax that was used in class today and understanding what the result
of various formulas would be.  I have a very good grasp of some of the beginning concepts of learning to use Ruby.

Git is something that I'm not as familiar with, but am starting to understand based on the lab time.

I feel good about arrays and general syntax of Ruby

  DAY 2

Today was all about Git and learning what it is and how to use it.  While I don't feel like an expert, I can navigate
pushing the files to GitHub and I'm happy with that learning today.
