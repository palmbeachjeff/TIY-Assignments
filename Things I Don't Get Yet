Some things that I could get a better understanding of:

-Using Git

-Navigating GitHub (will come with time) 

-Understanding some of the structure and logic behind more complex code.  To walk through the logic of 
this = that and this effects that would help me in understanding a little better.
e.g.- {|number,index|array[index]=number.to_i
